# Airlife ETL Pipeline Project

This project is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data related to aircraft and flight information into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline handles extracting data from OpenFlights and live flight data APIs, transforming it, and then loading it into the database for querying and analysis.

## Project Overview

This project implements an ETL pipeline that:
- **Extracts** airport and live flight data from APIs.
- **Transforms** the data by cleaning it and enriching flight data.
- **Loads** the data into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline is designed to run on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It checks for missing dependencies and automatically installs them, starts PostgreSQL if needed, and creates the required database if it doesn't exist.

## System Requirements

Ensure your machine has the following:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
  
For macOS and Linux, you can use package managers such as `brew` or `apt-get` to install missing dependencies. For Windows, follow the instructions to install PostgreSQL and Python manually.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airlife_etl.git
   cd airlife_etl
   ```

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**
   Set up a virtual environment (recommended) for your project:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv virtualenv
   source virtualenv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   .\virtualenv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**
   The `main.py` script will automatically handle installing dependencies, but you can pre-install them by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure PostgreSQL is Installed**
   Ensure PostgreSQL is installed. If itâ€™s not, follow the platform-specific instructions:
   - **macOS**: Use Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install postgresql
     ```
   - **Linux**: Use `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install postgresql
     ```
   - **Windows**: Download the installer from [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

## Running the ETL Pipeline

Once the setup is complete, you can run the ETL pipeline.

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Start PostgreSQL (if not already running)**:
   ```bash
   brew services start postgresql  # macOS
   sudo service postgresql start   # Linux
   net start postgresql-x64-14     # Windows
   ```

2. **Run the ETL Pipeline**:
   Execute the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Check for required Python packages and install any missing dependencies.
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running or attempt to start it.
   - Create the `airlife_db` database if it doesn't exist.
   - Extract, transform, and load data into the PostgreSQL database.

## Viewing the Loaded Data

After running the ETL pipeline, you can view the loaded data in your PostgreSQL database.

### Using `psql` (PostgreSQL CLI)

1. **Log into PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   psql -U <your_postgres_username> -d airlife_db
   ```

2. **List Tables**:
   To list all the tables:
   ```sql
   \dt
   ```

3. **Query Data**:
   To query data from the `airports` or `flights` tables:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 10;
   SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Automatic Updates

If you want the ETL pipeline to run automatically on a schedule and update the data in the database regularly, follow these steps:

### macOS/Linux (Using `cron`)

1. Open the crontab editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line to run the ETL every 2 hours:
   ```bash
   0 */2 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/main.py
   ```

### Windows (Using Task Scheduler)

1. Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
2. Set the trigger to "Daily" and set the recurrence.
3. Set the action to run your `main.py` with the Python interpreter.
4. Save the task.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **PostgreSQL Not Installed or Not Running**: If you receive errors related to PostgreSQL not running, check the logs using:
  ```bash
  brew services start postgresql  # macOS
  sudo service postgresql start   # Linux
  net start postgresql-x64-14     # Windows
  ```

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running and accepting connections on the right port (5432 by default).

- **Missing Dependencies**: If the script fails due to missing Python packages, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Logs and Errors

Check the logs in the console to identify any issues. For example:
- **ETL Pipeline Failure**: The error logs will indicate whether there was an issue in the extraction, transformation, or loading phase.
